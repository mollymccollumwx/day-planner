# Day Planner
This webpage features a simple day planner for the average work hours of 9AM - 5PM. The developer was provided with the CSS styling as well as a basic outline of HTML content and was tasked with creating dynamic content with jQuery. This website was created using moment.js which is *not* considered the best modern practice for tracking time.

# Installation
No installation is necessary. The user can access all the Day Planner features at the [deployed website](https://mollymccollumwx.github.io/day-planner/). The code for this webpage can be found at [Github](https://github.com/mollymccollumwx/day-planner). 

# Usage
When the webpage loads, the user is greeted with a schedule with times from 9AM to 5PM. The current hour of the day is highlighted in red, past hours are grey, and future hours are green.

The user can save an event or task to the schedule by using the blue save button on the right. That information is stored in local storage and will persist on the page.
